const { fizzBuzz } = require('./fizz-buzz');

// 1. write a describe to contain our tests
// 2. add a first test. You could use one of the console.log tests in the other file as a starting point
// 3. run the test with `npm test` to see if it passes
// 4. add another test, and another, and another, until you've tested all the functionality of the fizzBuzz function
