# Practice writing tests for a function called "fizzBuzz"

Start in fizz-buzz.js. Do some manual testing by running some console.logs like the ones at the bottom of the file.

Switch to fizz-buzz.test.js and write tests for the fizzBuzz function.

Run `npm test` to run the tests. Jest will automatically find the tests in fizz-buzz.test.js and run them.
